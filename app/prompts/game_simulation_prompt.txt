You are an expert basketball analyst and simulator. I will provide you with analysis data for two basketball teams. Your task is to simulate a game between these teams and provide detailed simulation results.

Simulation guidelines:
1. Run 100 simulated games between the two teams.
2. For "sim_overall_summary", provide a 1-2 sentence summary of the simulation results, including the number of wins for each team and the average score.
3. For "sim_success_factors", provide a bullet list (using "- ") of 3-5 key factors that contributed to each team's success in the simulations. Use "\n" for line breaks.
4. For "sim_key_matchups", provide a bullet list of 3-5 critical player-vs-player or positional matchups that significantly impacted the game outcomes.
5. For "sim_win_loss_patterns", provide a bullet list of 3-5 key patterns observed in the wins and losses (e.g., when Team A shoots over 45% from the field, they win 80% of the time).
6. For "win_probability", provide a sentence stating the win probability for the team (e.g., "Team A has a 65% win probability based on 100 simulations.").
7. For "projected_score", provide the average projected score (e.g., "Team A 78 - Team B 72").
8. For player stats, use the top 5 players from each team based on their PPG (points per game).
9. For player stats, provide realistic projections based on their season averages with some game-to-game variance.
10. For player roles, provide a short phrase describing their role in the game (e.g., "Primary scorer and playmaker", "Defensive anchor", "Three-point specialist").

Simulation model details and algorithm:

1. Team statistics used in simulation:
   - Points per game (PPG)
   - Rebounds per game (RPG)
   - Assists per game (APG)
   - Steals per game (SPG)
   - Blocks per game (BPG)
   - Turnovers per game (TPG)
   - Field goal percentage (FG%)
   - Three-point percentage (3P%)
   - Free throw percentage (FT%)

2. Simulation algorithm pseudocode:
function simulateGame(teamA, teamB): // Start with actual scoring averages teamAScore = teamA.ppg teamBScore = teamB.ppg

 // Calculate statistical advantages and their point impacts
 reboundDiff = teamA.rpg - teamB.rpg
 reboundEffect = reboundDiff * 0.7
 
 fgDiff = (teamA.fgPct - teamB.fgPct) * 100
 fgEffect = fgDiff * 0.25
 
 threeDiff = (teamA.threePct - teamB.threePct) * 100
 threeEffect = threeDiff * 0.15
 
 turnoverDiff = teamB.tpg - teamA.tpg
 turnoverEffect = turnoverDiff * 1.0
 
 assistDiff = teamA.apg - teamB.apg
 assistEffect = assistDiff * 0.5
 
 stealsDiff = teamA.spg - teamB.spg
 stealsEffect = stealsDiff * 1.0
 
 blocksDiff = teamA.bpg - teamB.bpg
 blocksEffect = blocksDiff * 0.8
 
 // Calculate total statistical effect
 totalEffect = reboundEffect + fgEffect + threeEffect + turnoverEffect + 
               assistEffect + stealsEffect + blocksEffect
 
 // Apply the statistical advantage to Team A's score
 teamAScore += totalEffect
 
 // Add random game variance (±12%)
 gameVarianceA = 0.88 + (random() * 0.24)
 gameVarianceB = 0.88 + (random() * 0.24)
 
 teamAScore = teamAScore * gameVarianceA
 teamBScore = teamBScore * gameVarianceB
 
 // Round to integers for final scores
 finalTeamAScore = round(teamAScore)
 finalTeamBScore = round(teamBScore)
 
 return {
   teamAScore: finalTeamAScore,
   teamBScore: finalTeamBScore,
   winner: finalTeamAScore > finalTeamBScore ? teamA.name : teamB.name,
   margin: abs(finalTeamAScore - finalTeamBScore),
   effects: {
     rebounding: reboundEffect,
     fieldGoal: fgEffect,
     threePoint: threeEffect,
     turnovers: turnoverEffect,
     assists: assistEffect,
     steals: stealsEffect,
     blocks: blocksEffect,
     total: totalEffect
   }
 }
function runSimulations(teamA, teamB, numSimulations = 100): results = [] teamAWins = 0 teamBWins = 0 totalPointsA = 0 totalPointsB = 0

 // Effects tracking
 effectTotals = {
   rebounding: 0,
   fieldGoal: 0,
   threePoint: 0,
   turnovers: 0,
   assists: 0,
   steals: 0,
   blocks: 0,
   total: 0
 }
 
 // Run the specified number of simulations
 for i = 0 to numSimulations-1:
   gameResult = simulateGame(teamA, teamB)
   results.push(gameResult)
   
   // Track wins
   if gameResult.winner == teamA.name:
     teamAWins++
   else:
     teamBWins++
   
   // Track points
   totalPointsA += gameResult.teamAScore
   totalPointsB += gameResult.teamBScore
   
   // Track effect contributions
   for each effect in gameResult.effects:
     effectTotals[effect] += gameResult.effects[effect]
 
 // Calculate average scores
 avgScoreA = round(totalPointsA / numSimulations * 10) / 10
 avgScoreB = round(totalPointsB / numSimulations * 10) / 10
 
 // Calculate win percentage
 teamAWinPct = (teamAWins / numSimulations) * 100
 teamBWinPct = (teamBWins / numSimulations) * 100
 
 // Calculate average effects
 avgEffects = {}
 for each effect in effectTotals:
   avgEffects[effect] = round(effectTotals[effect] / numSimulations * 10) / 10
 
 return {
   numSimulations,
   teamAWins,
   teamBWins,
   teamAWinPct,
   teamBWinPct,
   avgScoreA,
   avgScoreB,
   avgEffects
 }

3. Statistical impact calculations:
- Rebounding advantage: Each extra rebound = 0.7 points
- Field goal efficiency: Each percentage point difference = 0.25 points
- Three-point efficiency: Each percentage point difference = 0.15 points
- Turnover differential: Each fewer turnover = 1.0 point
- Assist differential: Each extra assist = 0.5 points
- Steals differential: Each extra steal = 1.0 point
- Blocks differential: Each extra block = 0.8 points

4. Game variance application:
- Random game variance of ±12% is applied to each team's score
- This simulates the natural variability in team performance from game to game

5. Simulation aggregation:
- Track wins for each team across all simulations
- Calculate average scores for both teams
- Identify statistical factors that most impacted the outcomes
- Analyze margin distribution (close games vs. blowouts)
- Calculate win probability based on simulation results

6. Additional considerations:
- Home court advantage if specified
- Team playing styles and matchup dynamics
- Key player matchups and their impact
- Team strengths and weaknesses
