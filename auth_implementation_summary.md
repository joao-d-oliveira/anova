c# Authentication System Simplification

## Problem
The original authentication system was using SessionMiddleware to store authentication tokens, but there were issues with the session management causing login failures. The error message "SessionMiddleware must be installed to access request.session" was appearing despite the middleware being properly configured in the main.py file.

## Solution
We simplified the authentication system by replacing the session-based approach with a more direct cookie-based authentication system. This eliminated the dependency on the SessionMiddleware and made the authentication flow more straightforward.

### Changes Made

1. **Removed SessionMiddleware**
   - Removed the SessionMiddleware from main.py
   - Eliminated the dependency on session management for authentication

2. **Updated AuthMiddleware**
   - Modified the middleware to check for authentication tokens directly in cookies instead of the session
   - Simplified the token verification process
   - Added proper cookie management for token refresh

3. **Updated Login Route**
   - Modified the login route to set authentication tokens directly as cookies
   - Removed session-based token storage
   - Maintained the same security features (httponly cookies, etc.)

4. **Updated Logout Route**
   - Modified the logout route to clear authentication cookies
   - Removed session clearing logic

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Removed a layer of complexity by eliminating the session management
   - Made the authentication flow more direct and easier to understand

2. **Improved Reliability**
   - Eliminated issues related to session middleware configuration
   - Reduced potential points of failure in the authentication process

3. **Maintained Security**
   - Continued to use httponly cookies for token storage
   - Preserved all security features of the original implementation

4. **Better Debugging**
   - Made it easier to debug authentication issues by simplifying the flow
   - Improved logging of authentication-related events

## Testing
The login functionality was tested with the provided credentials (joao.doliveira+2@toptal.com) and confirmed to be working correctly. The user was able to log in successfully and access protected routes.

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Cookie Security**
   - Consider adding SameSite attributes to cookies
   - Implement secure flag for cookies in production environments

2. **Token Rotation**
   - Implement token rotation for improved security
   - Add automatic refresh of tokens before expiration

3. **Remember Me Functionality**
   - Add option for users to stay logged in for longer periods
   - Implement secure long-term authentication

4. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Add more specific error messages for authentication failures
   - Implement better user feedback for authentication issues
